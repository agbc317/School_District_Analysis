# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gain a better understanding of the impact of various factors on the test scores of the schools in this district. This analysis was done in order to better understand which schools and areas can be improved and how best this could be achieved.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
  
  The district summary is not affected by the removal of these test scores.

- How is the school summary affected?

  There is no change in the school summary either.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  
  By removing the ninth graders' scores for Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores for the school go from being in the mid 60's to the high 90's. 
  
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and reading scores by grade
  
  Replacing these scores does not impact the scores by grade other than changing the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School. 

- Scores by school spending
  
  There seem to be no changes in the Scores by school spending data.
  All of the data points are identical in both DataFrames.

- Scores by school size
 
  I don't see any changes in the numbers for scores by school size either. The DataFrames have the same numbers again. 

- Scores by school type
  
  Again I see no change in the data for these two DataFrames.
